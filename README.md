openplanets.github.com
======================

This is the Open Planets Foundation GitHub site project, which produces the web
page that you see here http://openplanets.github.com.

Currently the page is a test area for a test HTML/JavaScript page that uses the
GitHub API to provide automated project status reporting.  The problem is the
limit placed on anonymous calls (60 per hour), and the lack of JavaScript
security, so it'll remain a test site to prototype ideas.

The real reporting site to be done in Java, and run on the Jenkins box, can use
OAuth.
